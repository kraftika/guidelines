Use case 1:

abc; => console

Reference Error: abc is not defined

Explanation: References which are neither properties or variables are by definition unresolvable and will throw a ReferenceError.
JavaScript sees no explicit base value and therefore looks up the VariableObject for a property with reference name ‘foo’. Finding none it determines ‘foo’ has no base value and throws a ReferenceError

Use case 2:

var abc;
abc => console

undefined;

Use case 3:

abc.efg => console

Reference Error: abc is not defined - JS cannot solve the reference efg of undefined abc

Use case 4:

var abc;
abc.efg => console

Type Error: Cannot read property 'efg' of undefined

Use case 5:

var abc = 4;
abc.mem => console

alert(meenme); => Reference Error: meenme is not defined
