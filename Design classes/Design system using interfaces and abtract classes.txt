Design system using interfaces and abtract classes

1. Decide what will be your classes and their memebers
2. How they will communicate with each other
3. Find out common things above classes
4. Then see if you can take all those common things and put them into other classes;
these will be parent classes. They can be or connot be abstract classses.
5. Then see if each method of yuor child class requires its own implementation
6. If you find those method then make those methods as abstract or pure virtual
7. If every method of your parent class is abstract or pure virtual, then it would
be better to make these classes as interface.
