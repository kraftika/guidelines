- AJAX = combination of Javascript and XML
- AJAX doesn;t require HTTP request
- It is written in Javascript and it uses XMLHTTPRequest Api to mainupulate XML data
to and from web server through HTTP
- It is used for form validation, filtering data etc. It is not used for all web page
content. It is used the information is changed frequently
- The page doesn;t reload so, the URL remains the same. Back and refresh are the main problem
of the AJAX but there is a solution using iFrame.
- If the javascript is disabled then it might be a problem. It depends on browser
settings.
- There is a problem on network because the application server must serve continously
http responses.
- The speed cannot be improved if the response is small. It can be use a client-side
cache written in Javascript because it is more effective than compression.
- AJAX doesn't require XML as XMLHTTPRequest object
- Are vulnerable to the XSS avoid by implementing HTTP Only Cookies and not allowing input from HTML
